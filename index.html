      <!-- 1. Problem of Evil -->
      <div class="objection">
        <h2>1. “If God is loving and all-powerful, why is there so much evil and suffering?”</h2>
        <p>Evil and suffering are real, and the question is legitimate. Christianity does not dodge it — it faces it head-on.</p>
        <p>First, God did not create robots. Genuine love requires genuine freedom, and freedom makes evil possible. A world with no possibility of moral evil would be a world without moral good.</p>
        <p>Second, much suffering is not pointless. It shapes character, awakens compassion, and draws people to God in ways prosperity never does (soul-making theodicy). Finally, and most importantly, Christianity claims God himself entered our suffering in Jesus and took the worst of it on the cross. The God of the Bible is not distant from pain — He is the crucified God who suffers with us and for us.</p>
        <p>This does not make every tragedy “make sense,” but it does mean suffering is not the final word. Resurrection is.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 2. Historical Jesus / Bible Reliability -->
      <div class="objection">
        <h2>2. “There’s no good evidence Jesus even existed, and the Bible is full of myths and contradictions.”</h2>
        <p>Jesus is mentioned by at least nine ancient non-Christian sources within 100 years of his death (Tacitus, Josephus, Pliny the Younger, etc.). No serious historian today denies he existed.</p>
        <p>The New Testament documents are earlier and better attested than any other ancient work. We have over 5,800 Greek manuscripts — the next closest (Homer’s Iliad) has fewer than 2,000, with a much larger time gap. The Gospels show undesigned coincidences and embarrassing details that invented legends almost never include.</p>
        <p>The minimal facts argument (accepted by the majority of scholars, even skeptical ones): Jesus died by crucifixion, his tomb was found empty, multiple people experienced what they believed were post-mortem appearances, and the rapid rise of Christianity in Jerusalem is otherwise inexplicable. The resurrection remains the best historical explanation.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 3. Science vs God -->
      <div class="objection">
        <h2>3. “Science has disproved God — evolution, Big Bang, etc.”</h2>
        <p>Most of the founders of modern science (Newton, Kepler, Boyle, Maxwell) were Christians who saw their work as “thinking God’s thoughts after Him.” The Big Bang theory was first proposed by a Catholic priest, Georges Lemaître.</p>
        <p>The universe had a beginning (standard cosmology), is finely tuned for life to an incomprehensible degree, and the origin of biological information remains unexplained by purely natural processes. Leading scientists — Francis Collins, John Polkinghorne, Arno Penzias, etc. — see no conflict between rigorous science and Christian faith.</p>
        <p>Science describes how the universe works. Christianity tells us why it exists and what its purpose is. They answer different questions.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 4. Exclusivity / Pluralism -->
      <div class="objection">
        <h2>4. “Christianity is arrogant — every religion claims to be the only truth.”</h2>
        <p>The claim “all religions lead to God” sounds humble, but it’s logically incoherent. Christianity says salvation is by grace through Christ’s atonement. Islam says by works and submission. Buddhism denies a personal God entirely. These cannot all be true at the same time.</p>
        <p>Christianity is unique in making testable historical claims (especially the resurrection). No other world religion rises or falls on an empty tomb in Jerusalem. If the resurrection happened, Christianity is true — not because Christians are better, but because Jesus rose.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 5. Hypocrisy / Harm -->
      <div class="objection">
        <h2>5. “Christians are hypocrites and Christianity has caused wars and harm.”</h2>
        <p>Christians have failed spectacularly at times — crusades, inquisitions, abuse scandals. Jesus himself predicted wolves would come in sheep’s clothing. The existence of counterfeit money does not disprove real money.</p>
        <p>Compare the 20th-century atheist regimes (Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot) — over 100 million killed in peacetime. No one dismisses atheism because of them. Judge a worldview by its founder, not its abusers. Jesus lived a life of perfect love and sacrifice. That’s the standard.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- 6. Trinity -->
      <div class="objection">
        <h2>6. “The Trinity makes no sense — it’s illogical and sounds like polytheism.”</h2>
        <p>The doctrine is hard, but not contradictory. Christianity affirms one God in essence, three distinct Persons (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) who share that one divine nature eternally.</p>
        <p>Jesus is worshipped as God (John 20:28; Hebrews 1:6), prays to the Father as distinct, and sends the Spirit. Yet Scripture repeatedly insists there is only one God (Deut 6:4; James 2:19). The church did not invent the Trinity at Nicaea — it fought to preserve what the Bible already taught against oversimplifications.</p>
        <p>No analogy is perfect (mind/will/memory, sun/light/heat, etc.), but once you distinguish “being” (what) from “person” (who), there is no logical contradiction. The Trinity is not a puzzle to solve but a God to worship — a perfectly loving community before creation even existed.</p>
